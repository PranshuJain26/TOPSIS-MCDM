TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution)

This repository contains an implementation of the TOPSIS method, a popular multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) technique. TOPSIS helps in ranking alternatives based on their distance from the ideal solution (best) and the negative-ideal solution (worst).

ðŸš€ Features

Implementation of TOPSIS in Python using Jupyter Notebook.

Handles decision matrices with multiple alternatives and criteria.

Supports weighted and normalized decision matrices.

Provides a step-by-step breakdown of:

Normalization of data

Weighted normalized decision matrix

Identification of ideal best and ideal worst solutions

Calculation of separation measures

Calculation of relative closeness to ideal solution

Final ranking of alternatives

ðŸ§  Applications

Supplier selection

Project prioritization

Performance evaluation

Financial decision-making

Resource allocation
